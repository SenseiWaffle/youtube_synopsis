# youtube_synopsis

Personal project inspired by The Colors of Motion (https://thecolorsofmotion.com/).

User gives a search phrase, the program will search YouTube and pull the first search result and create an image based on the dominant colors of that video.
Each stripe represents one frame of the video. Frames are taken in regular intervals and the color is determined by the most "dominant" color of the frame.
User can customize parameters such as search phrase, number of stripes/slices, and image dimensions (square or rectangle).

You can find some finished examples in the "synopses" folder.
